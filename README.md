# Introduction

This is a small pet project started cause... lazy.  Lazy in the sense that I will spend a few days building this so I don't have to go the manual route in finding what this web app will do for me.

## Background

I play guitar among a few other instruments and wanted to find random chord patterns to play because I get stuck on one and every time I pick up the guitar I start playing the same progression and eventually I'm so sick of it I don't want to play anymore.

Started to think of ways to generate random keys and patterns to play just to keep myself entertained.  

## In came the dice

So rolling dice can generate a random number and having about 5 pounds of various sided die I began to experiment with different sided die to accomplish a system of rolling a few dice and gathering a key to play and a set of chords. *(sorry but a tad bit of theory is needed to understand this concept.)*. A 12 sided die would set the key. A D&D emotion die set the mode *(minor or Major)* and a few other 4, 5, 6 sided die would set the chords to play in the progression. i.e. roll a 3 (*key is Bb)* roll a smiley face *(Major)* then rolls the chord die, say 1,5,2 *(BbMaj, FMaj, Cmin)*.

Now play with it. Turn on the looper and sketch out a rhythm, and start to jam over it.  If it sounded gross, I would just rinse and repeat.

This is all good and well but like I said I'm lazy so wasn't rolling the dice and started getting stuck on a progression for a few days.

##  Duh I can build something for this

So here we are, a small web app to pull up on the phone and it will give me a random this and that. Great let's jam!

But then the developer side of me kept going.

It is now something that has become a small monster as I keep thinking of ways to make it better and make it more fun and blah blah blah.

We all know this path.

## So what now

Well if you’re a musician just download and put it on a server and run, if you’re not a developer you can find it at [chord.danferth.com](http://chord.danferth.com) if you want to use it.

## Things to note

- This was built for mobile although it will work on any device, just may not look as nice.
- It's in its infancy so the code hasn't been refactored or optimized yet *(keep thinking of ideas and it's a pet project)* and there may be a bug or two if your just downloading from here.
- You can use it if you like for personal use but if you want to post this to your website just give me credit for it and let me know so I can see it in the wild somewhere else.
